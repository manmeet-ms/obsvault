- A shell scripting language. stands for `B`ourne `A`gain `SH`ell. 
- Easy commands 

Well, python is preferred for advanced shell scripting.

### First Bash Script

```bash
echo "Hello World"
```

`echo` -  Used to display/print things on terminal screen

`ls` - To list all files and folders in a current directory.

`pwd` - Print Working Directory

`cd` - Change Directory

>Comments are represented by `#`.

### Shebang
To specify which shell to use denoted by `#!`
e.g.  `#!/PATH-of-shell`

### Variables

```bash
greet="Have a good day"
echo $greet
```

>Do NOT use spaces in declaring defining variables

### Guidelines for naming variables in bash

1. A variable name may be alphanumeric, or it may be written with an underscore (`_`).
2. A variable name is case-sensitive.
3. Avoid using reserved words.
4. Use `camelCase` or `snake_case` for naming variables.
5. Avoid using special characters and spaces in variable names.
6. Use all caps for constants and environment variables 
7. Don't leave spaces around (`=`) when setting a variable's value

### User Input
User input is taken by `read`  keyword

```bash
echo "What is your name:"
read name
echo "Hey!" $name
```

```output
What is your name:
Manmeet Singh
Hey! Manmeet Singh
```

```bash
echo "What is your first name:"
read fname
echo "What is your last name:"
read lname
echo "Hey!" $fname $lname
```

# 2. Positional Arguments
Arguments are a specific  position

The arguments which we give on the fly in command line counted as `$1`, `$2`, etc ...

`$0` is reserved for shell itself 

```bash
read $1 $2
echo Heya $1 $2
```

```Execution

./positionalArguments.sh Manmeet Singh
Heya Manmeet Singh
```

# 3. Piping
Send command output to other commands 
Operator used `|`

Piping filters out specific words and displays the output

```bash
echo Hello There | grep there
```

###### Example
![[piping.png]]

# 4. Output redirection
- `>` is the symbol to write to a file
- `>>` is the symbol to append to a file

```bash
echo paragraph1 > file.txt # using > again will overwrite whole file
cat file.txt

echo
echo paragraph2 >> file.txt
cat file.txt
```
Using `>` again for same file will overwrite it.

>To get a word count in a file we use `wc -w < file`. More at `wc --help`.

```shell
$ wc --help 

Usage: wc [OPTION]... [FILE]...
  or:  wc [OPTION]... --files0-from=F
Print newline, word, and byte counts for each FILE, and a total line if
more than one FILE is specified.  A word is a non-zero-length sequence of
printable characters delimited by white space.

With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

The options below may be used to select which counts are printed, always in
the following order: newline, word, character, byte, maximum line length.
  -c, --bytes            print the byte counts
  -m, --chars            print the character counts
  -l, --lines            print the newline counts
      --files0-from=F    read input from the files specified by
                           NUL-terminated names in file F;
                           If F is - then read names from standard input
  -L, --max-line-length  print the maximum display width
  -w, --words            print the word counts
      --total=WHEN       when to print a line with total counts;
                           WHEN can be: auto, always, only, never
```

# 5.  Test operator  [ ] 
Built-in command. Takes arguments and show whether the expression is true or not.

`$?` shows the output of the last executed command (`0` or `1`)

###### Example 

```shell
[ hello = hello ] # Space is neccessary after square brackets
echo $?
```

```output
0
```

Exit Codes:
`0` - `True` The execution was successful 
`1` - `False` The execution failed

## Comparing numbers

```sh
[ 1 = 0 ]
echo $?
```

To make sure that the values are actually numerical, different sort of operator are/can-be used

```sh
[ 1 -eq 1 ]
echo $?
```

```output
0
```

`-eq` : Equal to
`-ne` : Not equal to
`-lt` : Less than
`-gt` : Greater than
`-le` : Less than or Equal to
`-ge` : Greater than or Equal to

# 6. Control statements

##### if-else 
```shell
read -p "Type yes to execute commands: " var
if [[ $var=y ]]; then
	echo Executing Commands...
else
	echo Process Aborted!
fi
```

Multiple checks can be achieved with an `if-else` ladder

###### Switch case
```shell

```

# 7. Arrays

 
```shell

```


not working:
positionalArguments.sh 
if else
when to put `" "` when to not
