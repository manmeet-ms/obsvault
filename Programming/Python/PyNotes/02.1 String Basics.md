Strings in python are surrounded by either single, or double quotation marks Strings are arrays of bytes representing
unicode characters.

Immutable data type, which means a string value/content cannot be updated/altered.

##### Example

```python
# Can not reassign 
t= "Immutability"
print type(t)
t[0] = "M"
```

```Output
t[0] = "M"
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
```

If you want to modify a string, you need to create a new string with the desired changes. String methods also can't
change existing string, they make it and return a new string


> üìù Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1

```python 
name = "Shane"  
name2 = 'Shenron'  
print(name, name2, sep="\n")  
print("Ohio " + name2)
```

```Output
Shane
Shenron
Ohio Shenron
```

To print conversational sentence through strings, we can either use escape sequences `\"` or enclose that variable in
single quote

```python
quotes_esc = "He said, \"Nice to meet you.\""  
quotes_singleq = 'He said, "Nice to meet you".'  
print(quotes_esc)  
print(quotes_singleq)
```

```
He said, "Nice to meet you."
He said, "Nice to meet you".
```

To print multi-line string, we enclose required text in triple quotes `'''`

```python
para = '''Name: Shenron  
Background: Certified Villager  
Age: Undefined  
'''  
print(para)
```

%% Automatic handling of newlines, punctuation if enclosed in triple quotes
para = '''Name: Shenron  
Background: Certified Villager,  
Age: "Undefined"  
'''  
print(para) %%

```Output
Name: Shenron
Background: Certified Villager  
Age: Undefined

```

# Accessing characters of  strings

String is like array of characters

### Through manual indexing

###### Example

```python
demo = "Indexing"
print(demo)
print("Character at index 0: " , demo[0])
print("Character at index 1: " , demo[1])
print("Character at index 2: " , demo[3])
print("Character at index 3: " , demo[5])
print("Character at index 4: " , demo[7])
```

```Output
Indexing
Character at index 0:  I
Character at index 1:  n
Character at index 2:  e
Character at index 3:  i
Character at index 4:  g
```

### Through `for` loop

The `for` loop allows you to iterate through the string's characters one by one, you can access and process each
character individually

```python
for i in range (0, len(demo)):  
	print(demo[i], end=", ")
```

```Output
I, n, d, e, x, i, n, g, 
```

### Using `in` Operator

To check if a certain phrase or character is present in a string, we can use the keyword`in`.

```python
for character in demo:  
	print(character, end=", ")
```

```Output
I, n, d, e, x, i, n, g, 
```
