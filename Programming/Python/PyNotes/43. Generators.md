generate values on the fly
list vs generators

special types of funtion

# Why use a generator? 


# Creating a generator 
`yield` keyword (used with a function ) makes a funtion a generator 

```python
def gen():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i


print("Function")
for y in gen():
    print(next(gen()), end=", ")

print()
my_gen = gen()
print("Variable")
for y in gen():
    print(next(my_gen), end=", ")
```
```Output
Function
0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
Variable
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
```
#discuss why calling in form of function and variable have different results?

# Advantages Benefits: (over iterable sequences)
- memory efficient
- genrators are lazy in a beneficial way. See [[43. Generators.py]] at last.
