Def:

usually works with conditional operators

# Conditional operators

- `<` - Less than operator
- `>` - Greater than operator
- `>=` - Greater than or equal to operator
- `<=` - Less than or equal to operator
- `==` - Equal to operator
- `!=` - Not equal to operator

# if-else statement

###### Syntax

```python
if (<condition>):
    # Code
else:
    # Code
```

# if-else ladder

###### Syntax

```python
if (<condition 1>):
    # Code
 
elif (<condition 2>):
    # Code

elif (<condition 3>):
    # Code
    
else:
    # Code
```

# Nested if-else

###### Syntax

```python
if (<condition 1>):
    # Code
    if (< condition 1.1 >):
        # Code
    else:
        # Code // More and more can be nested similarly depends upon use case
else:
    # Code
```

`else` statements may or may not be necessary to be declared.

# Shorthand if-else

One-liner, If you have only one statement to execute, one for `if`, and one for`else`, you can put it all on the same
line:

##### Syntax

```python
statement if condition else statement
```

##### Example

```python
a = 2
b = 330
print("A is greater") if a > b else print("B is greater")

###### Far better than Standard way
a = 2
b = 330
if  a > b:
	print("A is greater") 
else:
	print("B is greater")
```
