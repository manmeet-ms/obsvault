A Concept in Object-Oriented Programming

Getter and Setter methods are used to access and modify the values of private attributes in a class.

They provide a way to encapsulate the data and control how it is accessed and modified.

# Getters

Used to retrieve the value of an attribute. They typically have the following characteristics:

- They are defined as regular methods within the class.
- They do not take any parameters other than "self" (which represents the instance of the class).
- They return the value of the attribute.
- Property Decorator:
  Python provides a built-in decorator called `@property`, which allows you to define getter methods in a more concise
  and intuitive way. By using the property decorator, you can access the method as if it were an attribute, without
  explicitly calling it as a method.

   ```python

class Tomo:
def __init__(self, name, job):
self._name = name
self._job = job

    @property
    def passion(self):
        return self._name, self._job
	
	def info(self):
        print(f"{self._name} is {self._job}")

ally = Tomo("Shane", "Red Ranger ")  
ally.info()

```

```Output
Shane is Red Ranger 
```

Properties allow you to create read-only, read-write, and write-only attributes in a straightforward manner. They also
allow you to delete and document the underlying attributes.

# Setters

Setter methods are used to modify the value of an attribute. They typically have the following characteristics:

- They are defined as regular methods within the class.
- They take the new value of the attribute as a parameter, in addition to "self."
- They do not return any value.
- Setter Decorator:
  Similarly, Python provides another built-in decorator called `@<attribute_name>.setter`, which allows you to define
  setter methods in a convenient way. By using the setter decorator, you can assign a value to the attribute as if you
  were assigning a regular value to an attribute.

```python
class Tomo:
    def __init__(self, name, job):
        self._name = name
        self._job = job

    def info(self):
        print(f"{self._name} is {self._job}")

    # getter
    @property
    def passion(self):
        return self._name, self._job

    @passion.setter  
    def switch_job(self, newjob):
        self._job = newjob



```

With this implementation, you can set the `name` attribute as if it were a regular attribute:

> A setter might not run without a getter, like how will it get a hang of it... what to set/change? ðŸ¤£

   ```python
ally = Tomo("Shane", "Red Ranger ")
ally.info()

ally.switch_job = "Retired (Changed value)"
ally.info()
   ```

```Output
Shane is Red Ranger 
Shane is Retired (Changed value)
```

## Naming Conventions:

In Python, conventionally, the getter method is named with the prefix `get_` , and the setter method is named with the
prefix `set_` followed by the attribute name. #issue not wokrking as expected

Here are some key points to understand about getter and setter methods and properties in Python:

1. Getter and setter methods:
    - Getter methods are used to retrieve the value of a private attribute.
    - Setter methods are used to set the value of a private attribute.
    - Getter and setter methods can be defined like regular methods in a class,
    - Getter and setter methods can be used to implement data validation or perform additional logic before getting or
      setting the attribute value.
    - Using getter and setter methods ensures data encapsulation and provides a consistent interface in case internal
      details change.
    - However, in Python, it is generally recommended to use properties instead of getter and setter methods.

2. Properties:
    - Properties are a built-in feature in Python that allow you to define getter and setter methods in a more concise
      and Pythonic way.
    - Properties are defined using the `@property` decorator before the getter method. The setter method is defined
      using the `@<property_name>.setter` decorator.
    - Properties provide a way to access and modify attributes as if they were regular attributes, while still allowing
      you to add behavior and control the access and modification of the attribute.
    - Properties can be used to create read-only, read-write, and write-only attributes.
    - Properties can be deleted and documented like regular attributes.
    - Using properties instead of getter and setter methods is considered more Pythonic and provides a more elegant and
      intuitive way to work with attributes.
    - However, it is important to note that properties should be used judiciously and only when you need to add extra
      processing on top of a specific attribute. Turning all attributes into properties can lead to unnecessary
      complexity and potential performance and maintainability issues.

Here is an example that demonstrates the use of getter and setter methods and properties in Python:

```python
class Circle:
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self._radius = radius

    # Getter method
    def get_radius(self):
        return self._radius

    # Setter method
    def set_radius(self, radius):
        if radius >= 0:
            self._radius = radius
        else:
            raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")

    # Property for radius attribute
    @property
    def radius(self):
        return self._radius

    # Setter for radius property
    @radius.setter
    def radius(self, radius):
        if radius >= 0:
            self._radius = radius
        else:
            raise ValueError("Radius cannot be negative")

# Using getter and setter methods
circle1 = Circle(5)
print(circle1.get_radius())  # Output: 5
circle1.set_radius(10)
print(circle1.get_radius())  # Output: 10

# Using properties
circle2 = Circle(5)
print(circle2.radius)  # Output: 5
circle2.radius = 10
print(circle2.radius)  # Output: 10
```

In this example, the `Circle` class has a private attribute `_radius`. The getter method `get_radius()` and setter
method `set_radius()` provide access to this attribute. The `radius` property is defined using the `@property` decorator
and the `radius` setter is defined using the `@radius.setter` decorator. This allows you to access and modify
the `radius` attribute as if it were a regular attribute, while still providing the ability to add extra logic or
validation.

It is worth noting that while getter and setter methods and properties provide a way to encapsulate data and control its
access and modification, they are not always necessary in Python. In Python, all attributes are public by default, and
starting attribute names with an underscore is just a convention to indicate that the attribute is intended to be
private. However, this does not prevent direct access or modification of the attribute. Therefore, standard attribute
access is the normal, Pythonic way of accessing attributes. Getter and setter methods and properties should be used when
you need to add behavior to attributes or control access and modification, but they should not be used unnecessarily.

Overall, properties are the recommended way to add behavior to attributes in Python, as they provide a more concise and
intuitive syntax. However, the use of getter and setter methods can still be appropriate in certain situations, such as
when working with teams that are more familiar with the getter and setter pattern or when planning

# Q: Getter and Setter in Python detailed notes

They allow you to control how the attributes are accessed and modified, providing an additional layer of abstraction and
enabling you to enforce constraints or perform additional operations when working with attributes. Here are some

# Q: Getter and Setter analogy intuitive guide

Sure! Here's an analogy that can help you understand the concept of getter and setter methods in Python:

Let's imagine that you have a treasure chest in a game. The chest contains valuable items, and you want to control how
players can access and modify the contents of the chest. In this analogy, the treasure chest represents an object, and
the items inside the chest represent the attributes of that object.

1. Getter Method Analogy:
   Think of the getter method as a mechanism to retrieve items from the treasure chest. You, as the owner of the chest,
   have set up a system where players can only retrieve items from the chest through a special mechanism. The mechanism
   could be a guarded entrance, where players need to provide a valid ticket to access the chest's contents.

   In this case, the getter method acts as the guarded entrance. When a player wants to retrieve an item, they must use
   the getter method to access the attribute's value. The getter method verifies the player's credentials and returns
   the requested item.

2. Setter Method Analogy:
   Now, let's consider the setter method. As the owner of the treasure chest, you want to ensure that players cannot
   directly put or remove items from the chest. Instead, you provide a dedicated system for players to request item
   modifications.

   This system could involve players submitting a request form, where they specify the item they want to add or remove
   from the chest, along with the necessary information for validation.

   In this analogy, the setter method acts as the request form. When a player wants to modify an attribute (add or
   remove an item from the chest), they use the setter method. The setter method validates the request and performs the
   necessary actions to modify the attribute's value.

By using getter and setter methods, you maintain control over how the attributes (items) of the object (treasure chest)
are accessed and modified. You can enforce security measures, apply validation checks, or perform additional operations
whenever someone interacts with the attributes.

# Q: How a getter method is differs from return or print statement?

A getter method in Python differs from a simple return or print statement in several ways:

1. Purpose:
   A getter method is specifically designed to retrieve the value of an attribute from an object. Its purpose is to
   encapsulate the access to the attribute, providing a controlled mechanism to retrieve its value. The getter method
   may perform additional operations or checks before returning the value.

   On the other hand, a return statement is used to exit a function and return a value to the caller. It does not
   encapsulate the access to an attribute or perform any additional operations.

   A print statement, such as `print(attribute)`, is used to display the value of an attribute on the console or in a
   specified output stream. It is primarily used for debugging or displaying information to the user, rather than
   encapsulating attribute access.

2. Usage and Syntax:
   A getter method is defined as a regular method within a class, using the `def` keyword. It takes only one parameter,
   usually named "self," which represents the instance of the class. The method is accessed by calling it like any other
   method: `object.get_attribute()`.

   A return statement is used within a function or method to specify the value that should be returned to the caller. It
   is used in the context of functions or methods to exit the function and provide a result.

   A print statement, as mentioned earlier, is used to display information on the console or in a specified output
   stream. It is not directly related to encapsulating attribute access.

3. Encapsulation and Abstraction:
   A getter method contributes to encapsulation and abstraction in object-oriented programming. It hides the internal
   representation of an attribute and provides controlled access to it. By using a getter method, you can define the
   logic for accessing an attribute, perform validation, or return a modified value.

   A return statement, on the other hand, is simply used to provide a value as the result of a function or method. It
   does not inherently encapsulate or abstract the attribute access.

   Similarly, a print statement does not encapsulate attribute access or provide any abstraction. It simply displays the
   value on the console for debugging or informational purposes.

In summary, a getter method in Python is specifically designed to encapsulate and control access to an attribute by
providing a method-based mechanism to retrieve its value. It differs from a return statement, which is used to exit a
function and provide a result, and a print statement, which displays information on the console.

# Are attributes here refered to variables or class properties?

In the context of getter methods, the term "attributes" refers to the instance variables or class properties of an
object. These attributes represent the data associated with an object and can be accessed and modified through getter
and setter methods.

In Python, attributes can be defined at both the instance level and the class level:

1. Instance Attributes:
   Instance attributes are specific to each instance of a class. They represent the unique state of each object. These
   attributes are defined within the `__init__` method of a class and are typically initialized using the `self`
   parameter. Instance attributes can be accessed and modified using getter and setter methods specific to each
   attribute.

2. Class Attributes (Properties):
   Class attributes, also known as properties, are shared among all instances of a class. They represent data that is
   common to all objects of a particular class. Class attributes are defined outside of any methods within a class and
   are accessed using the class name. Class properties can also have getter and setter methods to control access and
   modification.

Getter methods are used to retrieve the values of both instance attributes and class attributes. They provide controlled
access to these attributes, regardless of whether they are instance-specific or shared among all instances.

For example, consider a `Person` class with `name` as an instance attribute and `count` as a class attribute:

```python
class Person:
    count = 0  # Class attribute

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name  # Instance attribute

    def get_name(self):
        return self.name

    @classmethod
    def get_count(cls):
        return cls.count
```

In this example, `get_name()` is a getter method that retrieves the value of the `name` instance attribute,
while `get_count()` is a getter method that retrieves the value of the `count` class attribute.

Therefore, in the context of getter methods, attributes refer to both instance variables and class properties,
representing the data associated with objects.
