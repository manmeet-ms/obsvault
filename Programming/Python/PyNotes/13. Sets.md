Mathematically, a set is a collection of well-defined objects.

- In Python, set is an **unordered*** collection data items.
- Sets are used to prevent repeated entries.
- Can store multiple values of different data types in a single variable.
- Items are separated with commas and enclosed within curly braces `{}`

> Sets are Immutable.

‚úè Unordered means that interpreter while printing output, doesn't follows same order of items in which they are kept
in. [[Why sets are unordered?]]

##### Syntax

```python
set = {"items1", 2, 3.0 , 4, True}
```

##### Example

```python
set = {2.4, 77, "Hawk", False, 57}  
set2 = {"items1", 2, 3.0 , 4, True}  
print(set, set2, sep="\n")
```

```Output
{False, 2.4, 'Hawk', 57, 77}
{True, 2, 3.0, 4, 'items1'}
```

See? No specific order followed.

##### Sets eliminate duplicate items

```python
rep = {2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6}  
print(rep)
```

```Output
{2, 3, 4, 6}
```

# Accessing items of a Set

Items are accessed via membership operator `in`

```python
set = {"Avatar", "The", "Last", "Airbender", "Book", 1, 2, 3}
for item in set:  
	print(item)
```

```Output
Avatar
2
3
1
Book
Airbender
Last
The
```

## Trivia! The type of an empty set

```python
empty = {}  
print(empty)  
print(type(empty))
```

```Output
{}
<class 'dict'>
```

> To create an empty set `set()` method is used #issue

# Set Methods

Done via dot(`.`) operator like this `set.union(set2)`

| Method                       | Description                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `union(set2)`                | Returns a new set that contains all elements from the current set and another set (set2).                               |
| `intersection(set2)`         | Returns a new set that contains only the common elements between the current set and set2.                              |
| `difference(set2)`           | Returns a new set that contains elements present in the current set but not in set2.                                    |
| `symmetric_difference(set2)` | Returns a new set that contains elements present in either the current set or set2, but not in both.                    |
| `issubset(set2)`             | Checks whether the current set is a subset of set2. Returns True if every element in the current set is also in set2.   |
| `issuperset(set2)`           | Checks whether the current set is a superset of set2. Returns True if every element in set2 is also in the current set. |
| `add(element)`               | Adds an element to the set if it is not already present.                                                                |
| `copy()`                     | Returns a shallow copy of the set.                                                                                      |
| `remove(element)`            | Removes the specified element from the set. Raises a KeyError if the element is not found.                              |
| `discard(element)`           | Removes the specified element from the set if it is present. Does not raise an error if not found.                      |
| `pop()`                      | Removes and returns an arbitrary element from the set. Raises a KeyError if the set is empty.                           |
| `clear()`                    | Removes all elements from the set, making it empty.                                                                     |
