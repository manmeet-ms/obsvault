We have used procedural programming so far. we were playing with prog control. #discuss

OOPs is Mapping data with real world concepts and entities.
Makes things easy, easy to maintain...

template so that data doesn't gets missed, uniformity

class is a blueprint and a class with specific properties known as object. Object is an instance of an class
class is a starting point, objects are %%real world%% entities.

properties are state of an object and methods are actions

# Features of OOP

## Encapsulation

capsule

Encapsulation is one of the fundamental principles of object-oriented programming (OOP). It promotes data hiding and
protects the internal state of an object from direct manipulation. Getter and setter methods play a vital role in
achieving encapsulation by providing controlled access to the object's attributes.

## Inheritance

extends

# Classes and Objects

##### Syntax

```python
class name:
	# Properties 
```

## Access

The properties of a class is accessed by a `.` operator

```python
class_name.property
```

###### Example

```python

class hashira:
    f_name = "Giyu"
    style = "Mizu"
    l_name = "Tomioka"

print(hashira.f_name)  
print(hashira.style)  
print(hashira.l_name)
```

```Output
Giyu
Mizu
Tomioka
```

## Modification

```python
Hashira.f_name = "Sanemi"  
Hashira.style = "Wind"  
Hashira.l_name = "Shinazugawa"
```

## Creating new objects with existing class

```python
h1 = Hashira()
h1.f_name = "Obanai"
h1.style = "Serpent"
h1.l_name = "Iguro"
```

Her we are making a new object `h1` from the existing class `Hashira`
