#discuss Allows us to assign a value within an expression

Python 3.8 onward 
shorthand to some context
readability maintained

##### Syntax
```python

```
# `:` operator

`':'` or `':='` What is the syntax?

Example
```python
# Without Walrus Operator
a=False
print(a)

# With Walrus Operator
print(a := False)
```

```Output
False
False
```

Example
```python
# Without Walrus
fav_food = []
while (True):
    food = input("Enter your favoutite food: ")
    if food == "q":
        break
    fav_food.append(food)
print(fav_food)

print()

# With Walrus
fav_food = []
while (food := input("Enter your favoutite food: ")) != "q": # we used while's shorthand a bit as well
    fav_food.append(food)
print(fav_food)
```

```Output
Enter your favoutite food: Salmon
Enter your favoutite food: Bonito Flakes
Enter your favoutite food: Tuna
Enter your favoutite food: q
['Salmon', 'Bonito Flakes', 'Tuna']

Enter your favoutite food: Salmon
Enter your favoutite food: Bonito Flakes
Enter your favoutite food: Tuna
Enter your favoutite food: q
['Salmon', 'Bonito Flakes', 'Tuna']
```
