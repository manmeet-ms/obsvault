Instance variables : #discuss 
- used when we have to associate a property to a particular object
- are specific 


```python
class Dev:
    def __init__(self, name, salary):
        self.name = name
        self.salary = salary
    def info(self):
        print(f"The name\'s {self.name}. Earns {self.salary}")


instance1 = Dev("Maggie", 100)
instance1.info()

```

```Output
The name's Maggie. Earns 100
```



class variables :
- made for a whole class shared by all instances 
- are generic 

```python
class Developer:
    class_var = "Value" # Class Variable
    
    def other_methods(self):
        # RElated to instances

```

```python

```
