list methods can be applied once a tuple is converted into a list

### `count` method

### `index` method

Returns the index of the first occurrence of the given element from tuple.

###### Example

```python
num = (1,72,35,14,5)
res = num.index(35)  
print(res)
```

###### Output

```output
2
```

###### `index` method for a specific range

###### Syntax

```python
tuple.index(element, start, end)
```

###### Example

```python
range_tup = (5, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41, 47, 53, 59, 65, 71, 77, 83, 89, 95)  
print(range_tup.index(29, 0, 7))  

# It will throw an error as 29 does not exists between he range of 7 to 15
print(range_tup.index(29, 7, 15))
```

###### Output

```output
4
Error
```

if it fails, then

```bash
ValueError: tuple.index(x): x not in tuple
```

### `len` method
