Tuples are ordered collection of data items. Can store multiple items of different data types in a single variable.

Tuples are separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses `()` .

> Tuples are Immutable

###### Syntax

```python
tuple_name = ("items1", 2, 3.0 , 4, True, False)
```

If we have to create a tuple with only 1 items in it we must have to leave a comma `(,)` after item

```python
tuple = (1,)
```

Otherwise,

 with                  | without              
-----------------------|----------------------
 `print(type( (1,) ))` | `print(type( (1) ))` 
 `<class 'tuple'>`     | `<class 'int'>`      

### Benefits of Tuples over Lists:

Tuples in Python offer several advantages over lists. Here are the benefits of using tuples based on the provided search
results:

Here's a tabular form comparing lists and tuples in Python, highlighting their respective advantages:

|                        | Lists                                     | Tuples                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Mutability             | Elements can be modified                  | Elements cannot be modified         |
| Iteration speed        | Slower due to potential modifications     | Faster due to immutability          |
| Use as dictionary keys | Not allowed                               | Allowed                             |
| Memory efficiency      | More memory usage due to dynamic resizing | Less memory usage due to fixed size |

**Use as dictionary keys**: Tuples can be used as dictionary keys, while lists cannot. This is because tuples are
immutable and their values cannot be changed, making them suitable for use as keys in dictionaries. Immutable values
like strings, numbers, or other tuples are allowed as dictionary keys. This feature can be useful when you need to
create a dictionary with unique keys or when you want to ensure that the keys remain constant.
