# Constructors

convenient way if making objects via passing arguments along with the object declaration.
helps in initialization. thats the main purpose
always returns `None`

## steps to make a constructor

#discuss dunder method

###### Syntax

```python
def __init__(self):
# Code
```

#imp This is dunder method `__init__()`  is a special method that is used in making of a constructor.

A constructor is always called a new object is made #discuss

> [!Important] Important
> Q: what is `self`? what's the importance #discuss
> A: self is here that auto-receives that newly-object-made as an argument itself
> ```python 
> class tailed_beast:
>		def __init__(self, arg1, arg2):
>	        self.name = arg1
>	        self.tails = arg2
>	        print(f"{self.name} has {self.tails} tails")
> k = tailed_beast("Kurama", 9)
> ```
> Here `k` is being passed to `self`. Note that!


> [!info] Well `self` is not necessary all the time,    
> the newly made object is passed to the very first argument
> ```python
> class SelfInnecessary:
>    def __init__(arnabGoswami, name, age):
>        arnabGoswami.name = name
>        arnabGoswami.age = age
>    def info(kuchBhi):
>        print(f"Name: {kuchBhi.name} | Age: {kuchBhi.age}")
>
>
>n = SelfInnecessary("Koji", 19)
>n.info()
>

### Parameterized and default constructors

Parameterized refers to the constructor which takes arguments and default constructors are the ones which taked no
argument (it takes self only).
