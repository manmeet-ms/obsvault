Lists are ordered collection of data items. They can store multiple items (even different data types) in a single
variable.

> Lists are Mutable

###### Syntax

```python
list_name = ["items1", 2, 3.0 , 4, True, False]
```

# Accessing elements of a list

Items in a list can be accessed by specifying its index like `list_name[i]`. Negative indexing is also seen in
lists [[2.2 String Methods#Negative Slicing]]

```python
marks = [2, 6, 6, 8]
print(marks[-3])
```

```
6
```

> We can check whether an item exists in a list or not: with `in` (membership) operator

```python
list = ["Marvel", 4, 66]  
if 4 in list:  
	print(True)  
else:  
	print(False)
```

Same thing applies for strings

# Modifying elements of a list

###### Example

```python
marks = [2, 6, 6, 8]

print("List Before: ", marks)  
marks[2] = 143  
print("List After: ", marks)
```

###### Output

```
List Before:  [2, 6, 6, 8]
List After:  [2, 6, 143, 8]
```

# Printing a list

### Case 1: Printing all elements of a list

Method 1

```python
list_p = [2.4, 6, 77, "Hawk"]  
print(list_p)
```

### Case 2: Printing a range of  elements (Slicing)

More info about slicing at [[2.2 String Methods#Slicing]]

```python
list_p = [2.4, 6, 77, "Hawk", True, 57]
print(list_p[:])  
print(list_p[2:4])
```

```
Case 2 (Default full) :  [2.4, 6, 77, 'Hawk', True, 57, 'Item 2']

Case 2 (Specific Range) :  [77, 'Hawk']
```

### Case 3: Universal Method

We can access/print either a specific range or full `list` with this method

```python
for i in range(0,len(list_p)):  
	print(list_p[i])
```

# List comprehension

Means generating a list on the fly

```python 
list = [expression(item) for item in iterable  if condition]
```

**Expression** :- Item which is being iterated

**Iterable** :- It can be list, tuples, dictionaries, sets and even arrays and strings

**Condition** :- Checks is the item should be added to the newly created list or not.

###### Example

```python
gen_list = [i for i in range(5)]  
print(gen_list)  
  
gen_alphabet = [chr(65+i) for i in range(5)]  
print(gen_alphabet)
```

###### Output

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']
```
