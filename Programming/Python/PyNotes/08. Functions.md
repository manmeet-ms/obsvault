# Introduction

Functions are blocks of code that execute a specific task when called. Parameters can be passed into functions, and they
can also return data as a result. Working with functions is advisable in larger codebases to enhance organization,
modularity, and readability.

### Types of functions

1. Built-in functions
   Example -   `min()`, `max()`, `type()`, `tuple()`, `list()`, `len()`, `sum()`, `print()`

2. User-defined functions

### Benefits of working with functions

1. **Code reuse**: Functions allow you to define reusable blocks of code, reducing redundancy and promoting modular
   programming. Repetition can be seen in [[8. Functions.py]]
2. **Readability**: Functions help break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable parts, improving the overall
   readability of your code.
3. **Abstraction**: Functions abstract away implementation details, allowing you to focus on the high-level logic of
   your program.
4. **Testing and debugging:** Functions enable easier testing and debugging since you can isolate and test individual
   parts of your code independently.
5. **Collaboration**: Functions facilitate collaboration by providing a clear interface and enabling different team
   members to work on separate functions simultaneously.

##### Syntax:

```python
def name(): # Funtion definition
	# Code statements / Function body
```

We can also use `pass` keyword if we want to deal with that particular function later, interpreter will overlook this

```python
def average():
	pass
```

##### Example:

```python
def calc_mean(p, q):  
	mean = (p + q) / 2  
	print("1st Num: ", p, "| 2nd Num: ", q)  
	print("Arithmetic Mean: ", mean)  
	print()  
  
# Calls
calc_mean(10, 42)  
calc_mean(53, 7)  
calc_mean(10, 4)
# 8 lines of code and we worked with three cases
```

###### Output:

```
1st Num:  10 | 2nd Num:  42
Arithmetic Mean:  26.0

1st Num:  53 | 2nd Num:  7
Arithmetic Mean:  30.0

1st Num:  10 | 2nd Num:  4
Arithmetic Mean:  7.0
```

---
Code without functions:

```python
a = 3  
b = 5  
a_mean = (a + b) / 2  
print(a)  
print(b)  
print("Mean:", a_mean)  

c = 4  
d = 57  
a_mean = (c + d) / 2  
print(c)  
print(d)  
print("Mean:", a_mean)  
  
m = 7  
n = 5  
a_mean = (m + n) / 2  
print(m)  
print(n)  
print("Mean:", a_mean)
# 18 lines! For 3 cases
```

###### Output:

```
3
5
Mean: 4.0
4
57
Mean: 30.5
7
5
Mean: 6.0
```

# Function Arguments and return statement

Types of arguments we can provide/pass to a function

- Default Arguments
- Keyword Arguments
- Variable Length Arguments
- Required Arguments

###### 1. Default Arguments

The program will take the already provided default values if any parameter(s) is not passed in a function call.

###### Syntax

```python
def name(name="arg", b=20,):
```

###### Example

```python
def add(a=10, b=20, c=4): # Default args/Values  
	print("Value of a:", a, "| b:", b, "| c:", c)  
	print("The sum is: ", a + b + c)  
	print()
  
  
add() # Case 1: All fetched from default args  
add(12, 6) # Case 2: It will take default value of `c` only  
add(1, 8, 3) # Case 3: We explicitly gave all parameters
```

###### Output

```
Value of a: 10 | b: 20 | c: 4
The sum is:  34

Value of a: 12 | b: 6 | c: 4
The sum is:  22

Value of a: 1 | b: 8 | c: 3
The sum is:  12
```

###### 2. Keyword Arguments

We can provide arguments with key=value, this way interpreter recognizes the arguments by its parameter name. (Usage:
while calling a function)

###### Syntax

```python
def any_func(args 1,2,3...):
	# body

func_call(key="value", z='2', a=10) # argument order doesn't matter here
```

###### Example

```python
def print_name(first, mid, last = "Emily"):  
	print("Name:", first, mid, last)  
	  
	  
	print_name(mid="Shane", first="John")  
	print_name("Lady", "Noir")  
	print_name("Lady", "Noir", "Jane")
```

###### Output

```
Name: John Shane Emily
Name: Lady Noir Emily
Name: Lady Noir Jane
```

###### 3. Variable Length Arguments

###### Example 1

```python
def average(*number): # passing arg as a tuple  
	sum = 0  
	for i in number:  
	sum += i  
	# avg = sum / len(number)  
	avg = sum/i  
	print(avg)  
  
average(1, 2)  
average(1, 2, 3)  
average(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

###### Output

```
1.5
2.0
3.0
```

###### Example  2

```python
def note(**name): # passing args as a dictionary  
	print(name["fn"], name["mn"], name["ln"], name["arg4"])  
  
note(fn="Boku", mn="Wa", ln="Tobi", arg4="#kawaii")
```

###### Output

```
Boku Wa Tobi #kawaii
```

###### 4. Required Arguments

This becomes required if we don't set/provide any default value, in case we don't pass key=value syntax. Then it is
necessary to pass the arguments in the correct positional order and the the number of arguments passed should be equal
to the function definition.

###### Syntax

```python
def func(arg1, arg2, arg3):
	# Code
```

###### Example

```python
def print_name(first, mid, last):  
	print("Your name:", first, mid, last)  
  
  
print_name("M", "R", "Sarvarkar")
```

###### Output

```
Your name: M R Sarvarkar
```

## Return statements

The return statement is used to return the value of the expression back to the calling function

###### Syntax

```python
def name():
	# Code
	return
```

###### Example

```python
def average(*number): # passing arg as a tuple  
	sum = 0  
	for i in number:  
	sum += i  
	avg = sum / len(number)  
	return sum / len(number)  
	# `OR an alternative way -->` return avg  

# Funtion Call
c = average(1,5)  
print(c)
```

###### Output

```
3.0
```

Statements after very first `return` becomes unreachable
![[Pasted image 20230622222937.png]]

it will print `none` if no return is specified

```python
def average(*number): # passing arg as a tuple  
sum = 0  
for i in number:  
sum += i  
avg = sum / len(number)  
  
# it will print `none` if no return is specified  
c = average(1,5)  
print(c)
```

###### Output

```
None
```

## Parameters or Arguments?

The terms_parameter_and_argument_can be used interchangeably for the same thing: information that are passed into a
function.

From a function's perspective:
> A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. An argument is the value that is
> sent to the function when it is called.
