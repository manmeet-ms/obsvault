# Definition of Virtual Environments

A virtual environment is a tool that helps to keep dependencies required by different projects separate, by creating
isolated Python environments for them. It is a practical way to avoid conflicts between system dependencies and
project-specific dependencies.

Virtual Environment in Python is a self-contained directory tree that includes a Python installation for a particular
version of Python, plus a number of additional packages. It allows you to have different Python projects with unique
environments on the same machine without conflicts in the libraries and dependencies.

###### To create a new virtual environment

```sh
python -m venv name
```

Breakdown |d
---|---
`-m` | Run library module as a script.
`venv` | Package used for creating virtual environments.
`name` | Name of the custom environment.

###### To activate a virtual environment

```sh
source name/bin/activate
```

###### To deactivate a virtual environment

```sh
deactivate 
```

Simply type deactivate anywhere anytime in the terminal.

> To install a package of specific version we use `==` and then specify version after it

```sh
pip install pkgname==v.x.x
```

# Advantages of Virtual Environments

## 1. Control over the Environment

With a virtual environment, you have complete control over the environment. You know the package versions that are
required to be updated and what versions are installed. Virtual environments give you a replicable and stable
environment. You have complete control over the versions of Python used, the installed packages, and their scheduled
upgrades.

## 2. Efficiency and Cost Reduction

Virtualization can lead to a more efficient use of the physical computer hardware, it enables a single physical machine
to act as multiple virtual computers, which allows for more efficient use of available hardware, lower costs, and
improved DevOps efficiency.

## 3. Disaster Recovery

In a virtualized environment, it’s easy to provision and deploy, allowing you to replicate or clone the virtual machine
that’s been affected. The recovery process would take mere minutes as opposed to the hours it would take to provision
and set up a new physical server, significantly enhancing the resiliency of the environment and improving business
continuity.

## 4. Flexibility

Virtual environments provide flexibility as they are easy to create and delete. With virtual environments, developers
can quickly spin up a virtual machine without impacting a production environment, ideal for Dev/Test scenarios.

## 5. Environmentally Friendly

Virtualization is an eco-friendly approach to IT. Reducing hardware requirements also reduces power consumption,
ultimately minimizing our carbon footprint. This is good for both the environment and your bottom line.

# Understanding `requirements.txt`

###### `pip freeze` command

```sh
pip freeze
```

###### Output

![[Pasted image 20230701224811.png]]

```sh
pip freeze > '17. requirements.txt'
```

The above command will bundle up all of the installed packages in a file named [[17. requirements.txt]]

Which comes in handy to distribute our program further along with the dependencies all at once.

###### Downloading packages from `requirements.txt`

```sh
python install -r requirements.txt
```
