# Raising Custom Errors

Why do we have to do so?
Custom error are raised with `raise` keyword

Unexpected error handled by inbuilt Python. Intentional error conditions made by `raise` and handling is done then

##### Syntax

```python
raise Type_of_Errror("Message (optional)")
```

Explore errors in docs [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library.exceptions.html).

##### Example 1

```python
rating = float(input("Rate us from 1-5: "))  
if 1 < rating < 5:  
	print("Thanks for the feedback!")  
else:  
	raise ValueError("Enter a value between 1-5")
```

```Output
# 1. Under Normal Condition

Rate us from 1-5: 4.7
Thanks for the feedback!
```

```Output 
# 2. Custom Exceptions Condition

Rate us from 1-5: 0
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Raising Custom Errors.py", line 6, in <module>
    raise ValueError("Enter a value between 1-5")
ValueError: Enter a value between 1-5
```

##### Example 2

```python
pan = input("Enter PAN")  
salary = int(input("Enter salary: "))  
if 10000 > salary or salary > 100000:  
	raise ValueError("Enter a valid amount of salary")
```

```Output
Enter PAN: ABCRH1234D
Enter salary: 1000
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "Example 2.py", line 4, in <module>
    raise ValueError("Enter a valid amount of salary")
ValueError: Enter a valid amount of salary
```

# Defining Custom Exceptions

We define custom exceptions by creating a new class that is derived from the built-in `Exception` class

##### Syntax

```python
class CustomError(Exception):
	# Code/Conditions # Done 

# trying new custom error
try:
	# Code
	
except CustomError:
	# Code
```

This is useful because sometimes we might want to do something when a particular exception is raised. e.g. Sending error
reports to admin, calling an API, etc.

##### Syntax

```python

```

##### Example

```python

```

```Output

# Difference between Handling errors and Raising errors

|                   | Handling Errors                                                       | Raising Errors                                                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Definition        | Process of gracefully managing and responding to errors               | Explicitly triggering an exception to indicate an error condition |
| Purpose           | To prevent program termination and provide error recovery             | To indicate exceptional conditions and control program flow       |
| Usage             | Used within `try-except` blocks to catch and handle errors            | Used with `raise` keyword to raise exceptions                     |
| Responsibility    | Deals with the aftermath of an error                                  | Initiates and signals an error condition                          |
| Execution         | Code within the `except` block is executed when an error occurs       | Code following the `raise` statement is executed                  |
| Error Propagation | Error handling allows for graceful propagation and handling of errors | Raising errors propagates the exception up the call stack         |
| Customization     | Allows for customization of error handling logic                      | Allows for customization of exception details and types           |
| Error Information | Access to exception information through the caught exception          | Provides detailed information about the error condition           |
| Exception Types   | Can handle both built-in and custom exception types                   | Can raise both built-in and custom exception types                |
