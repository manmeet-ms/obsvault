# Types of inheritance

## 1. Single Inheritance
most
common
type
of
inheritance
[[29.1 Single Inheritance.canvas |29.1 Single Inheritance]]


def


###### Syntax
```python
class ParentClass:
    pass  # Code


class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    pass  # Code

```

###### Example
```python


class Car:
    def start(self):
        print("*Chassis shakes... and Started!")


class Mercedes(Car):
    def start(self):
        print("Engine Throttle...\nNitro Fired! Vroom Vroom!!!"

swift = Car()
swift.start()

biome = Mercedes()
biome.start()

```

```Output
*Chassis
shakes... and Started!

Engine
Throttle...
Nitro
Fired! Vroom
Vroom!!!
```


## 2. Multiple Inheritance

    - multi
    parents

# discuss MRO Method Resolution Order

###### Syntax
```python
MultipleIheritedClassName.mro()
```
it
doesn
't print by default

> [!Question] Which
method
will
be
called if the
inherited
classes
have
the
same
function
defined
inside
them?
> The


class which comes first in order of inheritance.e.g.` class Child(P1, P2):` P1


's method will be called

###### Example
```python


class Employee:


# Code

class Designer:


# Code

class Developer:


# Code

class Marketer:


# Code

class Intern(Designer, Developer):


# Code

class HR(Employee, Designer, Developer, Marketer):


# Code
```


## 3. Multi-level Inheritance
def  # discuss
    [[29.3 Multi level Inheritance.canvas |29.3 Multi level Inheritance]]


##### Syntax
```python


class ParentClass1:


# Code

class ParentClass2(ParentClass1):


# Got props of P1

class ParentClass3(ParentClass2):


# Got props of P1 & 2

class ChildClass(ParentClass3):


# Got props of P1, 2 & 3 altogether
```

e.g.Grandfather > Father > Son

```Output
