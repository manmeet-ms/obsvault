# Opening a file

Before we can perform any operations on a file we must **first open that file**, specifying its mode and closing it is
also necessary at last.

###### Syntax

```python
var = open(name, mode)
```

Where,
var = To store the opened file in a variable
name = Name of our file
mode = Mode for opening file

- `r` = read, (Default mode)
- `w` = write
- `a` = append

# Modes of a file

> To get a mode in console:

```Python
print(open('22. filenotes.txt', 'w'))
```

```Output
<_io.TextIOWrapper name='22. filenotes.txt' mode='w' encoding='UTF-8'>
```

### 1. `'r'` Read Mode

Opens the file for reading only. The file pointer is placed at the beginning of the file. The file must exist, or else
an error will be raised.

```python
f = open("<file name>", "r")  # Text read
```

### 2. `'w'` Write Mode

Opens the file for writing. If the file already exists, it truncates (clears) any existing information. If the file does
not exist, it creates a new file. The existing file's content is deleted immediately. **Be cautious** and check if a
file exists before overwriting information by accident.

```python
f = open("<file name>", "w")  # Text write
```

### 3. `'a'` Append Mode

Opens the file for appending. The file pointer is placed at the end of the file. If the file does not exist, it creates
a new file. The data is added to the end of the file. The existing file's content is not deleted.

```python
f = open("<file name>", "a")  # Text append
```

### 4. `'x'` create mode

A file with the given name will be created.
Will throw error if file with the same name exists already.

## 5. Binary Mode

You can also open files in binary mode by appending 'b' to the mode. This is useful for non-text files like images or
executable files.

```python
f = open("<file name>", "rb")  # Binary read
f = open("<file name>", "wb")  # Binary write
f = open("<file name>", "ab")  # Binary append
```

## üìù Note

- Both Write and Append modes create a new file if the file does not already exist.
- These modes can be used in combination with others, like 'w+' (write and read), 'a+' (append and read), etc.

```python
f = open("<file name>", "w+")  # Textual write and read
f = open("<file name>", "a+")  # Textual append and read
```

# Don't mess with File IO modes

We can not use the functionalities of other modes in current work mode.  
Like opening a file in reading mode and then executing writing, appending methods on it. Error will be shown

##### Example 1

```Python
file = open("22. filenotes.txt", 'w')
print(file.read())
```

> [!error] ERROR
> io.UnsupportedOperation: not readable

We are not supposed to read a file when it is opened with writing mode. Like How can you XD?!

##### Example 2

```Python
file = open("22. filenotes other.txt", 'r')
print(file.read())
```

> [!error] ERROR
> FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '22. filenotes other.txt'

If we open a non-existing file in reading mode.

# File IO shorthand

```Python
with open('file', 'mode') as var:
	# Operations code statements
```

> [!IMPORTANT] Important
> One liner to open and close file

###### Example

File IO used for storing game data in file (for fun) üòâ

```python
from random import randint
rem_health = 4000
with open('22. filenotes.txt', 'w') as f:
    for health in range(4000, 0, -10):
        if rem_health >= 0:
            damage = randint(100, 1500)
            rem_health = rem_health - damage
            f.write(f"Damage Inflicted: {damage}, Health: {rem_health}. \n")
        else:
            f.write(f"Final Blow: {damage}, Health {rem_health} ")
            break
```

###### File Contents

```Output
Damage Inflicted: 597, Health: 3403. 
Damage Inflicted: 683, Health: 2720. 
Damage Inflicted: 263, Health: 2457. 
Damage Inflicted: 942, Health: 1515. 
Damage Inflicted: 833, Health: 682. 
Damage Inflicted: 707, Health: -25. 
Final Blow: 707, Health -25 
```

# `readlines()` method

As name suggests

###### Example

```python
f = open('22. filenotes.txt', 'r')
print(f.readlines())
```

```Output
['Damage Inflicted: 779, Health: 3221. \n', 'Damage Inflicted: 1415, Health: 1806. \n', 'Damage Inflicted: 490, Health: 1316. \n', 'Damage Inflicted: 1248, Health: 68. \n', 'Damage Inflicted: 204, Health: -136. \n', 'Final Blow: 204, Health -136 ']
```

# `writelines()` method

Method used to write a list of strings to a file.

- It takes a sequence (e.g., a list) of strings as input.
- Each string in the list is written to the file as a separate line.
- The method does not add any newline characters between the lines, so it's important to include them in the strings if
  desired.
- The `writelines()` method does not append a newline character at the end of the last line automatically.
- The file must be opened in write or append mode using the `open()` function before calling `writelines()`.
- The `writelines()` method does not insert any additional characters (such as spaces or commas) between the lines or
  modify the strings in any way.
- It is a useful method when you have a list of strings that you want to write to a file as separate lines efficiently.

> All accessed by `.` operator.

# `seek()` function

Allows us to move the current position to the specific point. **Position is specified in bytes**. Movable to either
forward or backward

# `tell()` function

Track/Tell the seek's current position

# `truncate` method

Trims to specific bytes
