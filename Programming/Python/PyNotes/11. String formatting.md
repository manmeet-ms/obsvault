# f-string

String formatting mechanism. Solved a problem of placing variables inside strings.

## 1. `format()` method

##### Example 1

```python
text = "My name is {}. My age is {}."  
name = "Mosh"  
age = 12  
print(text.format(name, age))
```

```Output
My name is Mosh. My age is 12.
```

##### Example 2

```python
# first var as `{0}` Second as `{1}` Third as `{3}`

text4 = "My name is {0}. My age is {1}. I am from {2}"
name = "Mosh"
age = 12
country = "Israel"
print(text4.format(name, age, country))
```

```Output
My name is Mosh. My age is 12. I am from Israel
```

## 2. `fstring` method

##### Syntax

```python
str_name = f"Lorem {var} Ipsum {var2}..."
```

##### Example

```python
price=12  
color = "Blue"  
prompt = f"Get the {color} shirts at ${price} off!"print(prompt)
```

```Output
Get the Blue shirts at $12 off!
```

%% **Sidenote:** We *literally* display fstrings syntax in console `{}` as `{{ }}`

```python
print(f"Get the {{color}} shirts")
```

```Output
Get the {color} shirts
```

## 3. `docstring` method

Python docstrings are the string literals that appear right after the definition of a function, method, class or module.

Like their description, represented by enclosing the text between `'''`. Worth notable that docstring isn't ignored like
a multi-line comment.

**Must declared right after declaration**, otherwise it will turn to a comment.

##### Syntax

```python
def name():
	'''Docstring Here'''
```

##### Example

```python
def function():  
'''Docstring body e.g. Description'''  
	print("Hello World")  
function()  
print(function.__doc__) # To print its docstring
```
