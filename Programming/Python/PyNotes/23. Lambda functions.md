Lambda function are used where a small function is required for a short period of time.

###### Syntax

```python
function = lambda arguments: expression
```

`expression` will be the return value of this function. Expressions can be damn complex!

- They are commonly used as arguments to higher-order functions such as map, filter, and reduce.
- We don't go with such approach when we have multiple lines of logic
- Small anonymous functions without a name, one liner for creating small functions.

> We have used variables to store our lambda functions, that's not a function's name.

###### Example

```python
twice = lambda a: 2 * a
print(twice(9))

square = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square(4))

power = lambda x, y: x ** y
print(power(5, 3))

average = lambda x, y, z: (x + y + z) / 3
print(average(3, 4, 5))
```

```Output
18
16
125
4.0
```

### Difference between standard approach vs lambda for making a small function

```python
# standard
def power(num, sup):
    return num ** sup
print(power(5,3))

# lambda approach
power = lambda x, y: x ** y
print(power(5, 3))

```

```Output
125
125
```

Why? ![[Pasted image 20230706225423.png]]
Because, you should not store them as callable variable *(as done in above variable)* but more in a`return`or as
callback argument of other functions

# lambda functions as an argument

###### Example

```python
func_power = lambda x, y: x ** y
def high(fx, num):  
	return f"Space has {fx} stars and {num} planets."  
print(high(func_power(567, 34), 9))

```

```Output
Space has 4186238836002171276556794074929218612025397779320474510762011818444873683722484803299980651729 stars and 9 planets.

```
