By default access is public
#repl
In Python, there are no strict access modifiers like in some other programming languages (e.g., private, protected,
public). However, a common convention is to use a single underscore prefix (e.g., `_name`) to indicate that an attribute
or method should be treated as "internal" or "protected" and should not be accessed directly from outside the class.
This convention is not enforced by the language itself but serves as a visual indicator for developers.

By using getter and setter methods, you can control the access to these "internal" attributes, ensuring that they are
only accessed and modified through the defined methods.

Overall, getter and setter methods, along with the property decorator, provide a way to encapsulate and control the
access to object attributes in Python. They help enforce encapsulation, add flexibility to your code, and enable you to
perform additional operations or apply constraints when working with attributes.

> name mangling is done to prevent accidental overwriting of attributes

private `__name` does mangling
protected `_name` doesn't
these are just adaptable conventions.
