Built-in function helps in looping over a sequence (such as list, tuple, or string) and get the index and value of each
element in the sequence at the same time.

###### Syntax

```python
for idx, val in enumerate(seq):
	print(idx, val)

# idx = index
# val = value 
# seq = sequence 
```

> First variable always return index and other value

###### Example 1

```python
seq = "Tokito"  
for idx, val in enumerate(seq):  
	print(idx, val)
```

```Output
0 T
1 o
2 k
3 i
4 t
5 o
```

Although, it is be possible with other approaches as well, but this comes in handy.

- Going with a single variable in an `enumerate` loop will bundle the result in `tuple` containing index and value of
  the sequence elements respectively.
  [[enum tuple.canvas|enum tuple]]

###### Example

```python
fruits = ("Banana", "Kiwi", "Orange", "Avocado")  
for c in enumerate(fruits):  
	print(f"Fruit Code: {c}")
```

```Output
Fruit Code: (0, 'Banana')
Fruit Code: (1, 'Kiwi')
Fruit Code: (2, 'Orange')
Fruit Code: (3, 'Avocado')
```

###### Changing the start index

To start with specific value. We can alter with index value (not literally, but mathematically at console)

- with `(start=' ')` argument. Must be an `int`

```python
veggie = ("Onion", "Potato", "Chilli", "Mint", "Lemon")
for idx, val in enumerate(veggie, start=1):
    print(f"At counter no. {idx}, we have {val}.")
```

```Output
At counter no. 1, we have Onion.
At counter no. 2, we have Potato.
At counter no. 3, we have Chilli.
At counter no. 4, we have Mint.
At counter no. 5, we have Lemon.
```
