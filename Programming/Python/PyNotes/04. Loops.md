Loops are used to perform a task numerous times. Loops provide a powerful mechanism for repetitive actions, automating
tasks & processing large datasets.

Python has two primitive loop commands:

- `while`loops
- `for` loops

### Benefits of using loops

1. Code repetition: Loops allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly, reducing the need for duplicating code
   manually. Implements DRY concept
2. Automation: With loops, you can automate repetitive tasks by iterating over a sequence or performing a set number of
   iterations. Loops also provide interactivity (User prompt)
3. Dynamic data processing: Loops enable you to iterate over data structures, such as lists or dictionaries, to perform
   operations on each element. Algorithm implementation
4. Efficient Iterative problem-solving: Loops are optimal for solving problems that involve iterating over data or
   performing incremental computations

## 1. `for` Loop

###### Syntax

```python  
for (start, end-1, increment):  
	# Code to be executed   
```

> start and increment parameters are optional

- ### For strings

###### Example

```python
name = "Goodman"  
for chr in name:  
	print(chr)
```

###### Output

```
G, o, o, d, m, a, n,
```

> var in iteration and printing (or the variable with which we would like to work with) must be same

- ### Iterating through list items

###### Example

```python
list = ["Orange", "Mango", "Melon", "Pear", "Kiwi"]  
for fruits in list:  
	print(fruits)
```

###### Output

```
Mango
Melon
Pear
Kiwi
```

## 2. `while` Loop

Executes statements while the condition is true, as soon as condition turns false, the interpreter takes exit from the
loop.

Why while loops?
we generally don't' use while loop with numbers, they are used in complex conditions

- ### Else statement with while loop

As soon as while loop condition turns false, interpreter exits the loop and enters into else statements

## 3. `do-while` Loop

They don't exist in python

###### Emulation

```python
do_num = 1  
print(do_num)  
do_num+=1  
while(do_num<10):  
print(do_num)  
do_num+=1
```
