# 1. `map()` method

###### Syntax

```python
map(function_name, iterable)
```

`map()` will be execute the logic of the function on all items present in list.

###### Example

```python
num_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

Suppose if we want to make a cube of every item.

```python
# Method 1

cn_list = []
for items in num_list:
    cn_list.append(cube(items))
print(cn_list)

# Method 2
new = map(cube, num_list)
print(new) # returns a map object; for efficiency purposes

print(list(new))
```

```Output
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216]

<map object at 0x7ff17eff2bc0>
[1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216]
```

###### Example 2

```python
text = "Hello" result = list(map(str.upper, text)) print(result) # Output: ['H', 'E', 'L', 'L', 'O']
```

# 2. `filter()` method

###### Syntax

```python
filter(function_name, iterable_name)
```

###### Example

```python
wlist = (2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 9)
print(wlist)
def filter_funtion(a):
    return a > 3
nlist = filter(filter_funtion, wlist)
print(nlist)
print(list(nlist))
```

```Output
(2, 1, 0, 3, 4, 9)
<filter object at 0x7f275e5b3e50>
[4, 9]
```

> [!important] Info
> 📝 **Q: Look at the function it is taking args! From where this function is receiving arguments?**
> A: The items in this iterable are passed as an argument
>
> 📝 **We can use/pass lamba functions here.**

###### Example

```python
nums={2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 9, 7}
print(nums)
new_num = set(map(lambda thrice: 3*thrice, nums))
print(new_num)
```

```Output
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9}
{3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 27}
```

# 3. `reduce()` method

we have to import it first
takes sequence of inputs, works of it and output it.

Applies a rolling computation to the items of the iterable, reducing them to a single value. It repeatedly applies the
function to the elements,

###### Example

```python
from functools import reduce
ex_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
reduce_list = reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, ex_list)  
print(reduce_list)
```

```Output
55
```

> [!question] Do they only work with lists, tuple?  
> No, `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()` functions in Python are not limited to working only with lists and tuples.
> They can be used with any iterable object, which includes lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, and more. View
