We have the following when JavaScript runs in a browser.
[![[Pasted image 20230811231941.png]]

# `window` Object

Represents browser window & provide methods to control it. It is a global object.
```js
window.console.log("msg");
console.log("msg");

alert("msg")
window.alert("msg")

// Are Same
```
# DOM - Document Object Model
A whole HTML page is made as object to JavaScript  and referred as document. 

**It is a JavaScript object-ified representation of an HTML page (document)**

Type `console.log(document)` in console to explore

# BOM - Browser Object Model
Represents additional objects provided by browser (host environment) for working everything except the document
`alert`,  `confirm` and `prompt` are part of BOM
Another e.g. `location.href = "https://redirect.com"`

# Walking the DOM 

#discuss DOM tree 
- text nodes (leaf node of a DOM tree)
- element nodes (tags)
- comment nodes

![[Pasted image 20230812224645.png]]

`document` = The DOM
`document.documentElement` = get whole html
`document.body` = returns page's body
`document.head` = returns head tag
`document.title` = returns page title as string
## Auto-correction in HTML 
Just auto closing of incomplete tags 

# Accessing the children, parents of an element 

## Children of an element 
Direct as well as deeply nested elements of an element are called its children

- **Child nodes** - are direct children e.g. `'<head>'` and `'<body>'` are the direct children of `'<html>'` tag  
- **Descendant nodes** - All nested elements, children > their children and so on...

##### Methods 
üìù `elem` is referred to an element that was accessed.

- `elem.firstChild` =  returns first direct child element 
- `elem.lastChild` = returns last child element 
- `elem.childNode` = returns a NodeList containing all descendants of that element.

Example HTML [[#Example HTML 9. JS in Browser.js.html here|click to jump ]]
```Example
<!--OUR EXAMPLE HTML DESCRIBED BELOW -->
```

```js
console.log("return first child:", document.body.firstChild);

console.log("return last child:", document.body.lastChild);

console.log("return all children of body as NodeList:", document.body.childNodes);
```
![[Pasted image 20230813162804.png|500]]

Following is always true
```js
elem.childNode[0]===elem.firstChild
elem.childNode[elem.childNode.length-1] === elem.lastChild
```
##### Example 1

```js
document.documentElement.childNodes[0]===document.documentElement.firstChild
// They will both return same element `<head>`

document.body.childNodes[document.body.childNodes.length-1]===document.body.lastChild
// They will both return same element 
```
*text node is also considered as an elements' child*

- `elem.hasChildNode()` = returns a boolean on the basis of whether the selected element has child or not

## Notes on DOM Collection 
- They are read-only.
- They are live, `elem.childNode` variable (reference) will automatically update if  `childNode` of elem is changed .
- DOM collections are iterable using `for-of` loop
## Sibling and Parent of an element 
![[Pasted image 20230813170514.png|350]]
Nodes or children of same parent 
##### Analogical Terminology for Siblings
- In the above doc tree, `'<head>'` and `'<body>'` are siblings, as they have same parent, in this  case `'<html>'` 
- `'<body>'` is said to be "next" or "right" sibling of `'<head>'`
	- Methods related to sibling are below: 
	1. `nextSibling` 
	2. `previousSibling` 
	3. `parentNode` 
	Should be used like before (`elem.method`)  

> [!important] Example
> We got desired result ONLY after removing text node of spaces before tags  (indentation of spaces)/after minifying.
With reference to our ongoing html

Node | Element 
---|---
Checks for any nodes.| Checks for element/tags.
Can return any of the comment, text node or element node|Only checks for element node otherwise `null`
Ex - `elem.parentNode`,Ex - `elem.firstChild ` |Ex - `elem.parentElement`

# Element only Navigation
# Table based Navigation
Access the table, execute the methods 
#discuss methods
# Searching the DOM

DOM navigation i sused to get the element whe they are closer to each other (firstChild, lastChild, nextSibling, previousSibling, etc.)
We **search** through the DOM if they are not close. *(a pattern may or may not be followed when searching)*
##### Methods

1. `document.getElementById` -
2. `document.getElementsByClassName` -
3. `document.querySelector` - In double quotes, CSS Selectors work here
-  without any sign, it with consider to find it as a tag
	e.g.  `document.querySelectorAll("h1")`
-  A dot `.` used to refer for a class 
	e.g. `document.querySelector(".class")`
-  A hash `#` for id
	e.g.  `document.querySelector("#unique_id")`
4. `document.querySelectorAll` - 
5. `document.getElementByName` - Searches the element eith `name = " "` attribute 
These methods are not bounded to be run on `document` only, they can be run under specific tag name to further deep searching. 

and many more, #discuss them

> [!important] Important 
> Although it is not a good practice but we can access the element by simply passing its CSS ID. without need of `getElementById`


# `matches`, `closest` and `contain` method
Important methods to search the DOM 

##### 1. `elem.matches(CSS_Sel_of_accesssed_elem)` 
Checks if element matches the given CSS selector | returns a boolean 
#discuss the practical use? 

Example
![[Pasted image 20230814193158.png]]
##### 2. `elem.closest(CSS_Sel_of_accesssed_elem)` 
To look for the nearest ancestor that matches the given CSS selector. This element also is checked. And if not, this recursively checks further ancestry. 
![[Pasted image 20230814193408.png]]
##### 3. `elem.contain(accesssed_elB)`
Returns boolean if the element `elB` is inside the element `elA` (a descendant of `elA`) or when `elA==elB`. An element is passed in it


##### Example HTML  (updated one [[9. JS in Browser.js.html|here]])
```html
<!--OUR EXAMPLE HTML-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Document</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Hello World
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <div class="container">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</p>
      <span>span</span>
    </div>
    
    <script src="0. Intro.js"></script>
    <script>
      console.log("Hello World inside script");
