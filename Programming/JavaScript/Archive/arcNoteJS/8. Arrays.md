Arrays are ordered collection of data items. They can store multiple items (even different data types) in a single
variable.

> Arrays are Mutable

###### Syntax

```js
let arr_name = ["items1", 2, 3.0 , 4, True, False]
```

# Accessing elements of an array

Items in an array can be accessed by specifying its index like `arr_name[i]`. Negative indexing is also seen in
Arrays [[2.2 String Methods#Negative Slicing]]

```js
let marks = [2, 6, 6, 8]
console.log(marks[-3])
```

```

```
# Modifying elements of an array
9
###### Example

```js
let marks = [2, 6, 6, 8]

console.log("arr Before: ", marks)  
marks[2] = 143  
console.log("arr After: ", marks)
```

```output
arr Before:  [2, 6, 6, 8]
arr After:  [2, 6, 143, 8]
```

# Printing an array

### Case 1: Printing all elements of an array

Method 1

```js
let arr_p = [2.4, 6, 77, "Hawk"]  
console.log(arr_p)
```

### Case 2: Universal Method

We can access/print either a specific range or full `arr` with this method

```js
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i])
}
```
