- Dynamically Typed Language (Variable's *type* can changed at runtime)

**ECMAScript** is a Standard in which JavaScript is based. It was created to ensure that different documents on JavaScript are talking about the same language.
JavaScript and ECMAScript are used interchangeably. JavaScript is very liberal in what it allows. *(semicolon pe error nahi deti)*

# Ways to execute JavaScript 

### 1.  In Browser

### 2. Node.js
#discuss A Runtime to execute JavaScript outside of the browser (*browser ka engine written in C++*)
How to run?

### 3. Inside `<script></script>` tags of an HTML file


# Very first JavaScript program 

##### Syntax 
```js
console.log("Hello World");
```

# Comments 
Single line comment  `//`
Multi-line comment `/*your story*/`

# User Interaction 

## 1. `prompt` 
Used to take user's input
#discuss  not works in node runtime (works in browser's console)
```
let a = prompt("Enter")
        ^

ReferenceError: prompt is not defined 
```


```js
let a = prompt("Enter", "default value of any type")
```
Second argument will be a default value to store into that variable.


## 2. `alert`
Used to invoke a mini window with a message 

```js
alert("You are about to leave this page. Changes may not be saved.")
```
## 3. `confirm`
As name suggests, invokes a mini window waiting dor the user's confirmation to press either 'OK' or 'Cancel'
Result printed in console is True or False respectively.

```js
confirm("Do you want to subscribe for a newsletter?")
```

Disadvantages in modern web development:
1. Look very basic
2. Blocks the main execution thread!
3. Exact location issues (hampers user experience )
