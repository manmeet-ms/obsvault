#discuss Containers  that store values. Values can be changed during the runtime.

##### Syntax 
```js
var name = "value"
```
`'var'`, `'let'`, `'const'` are keywords
`'name'` is identifier 
`'='` is assignment operator 
@RHS there are values/literals.


Dynamically changing values at runtime
##### Example 
```js
var box = 84
console.log(box)

// Updating a variable's type right at runtime 
box = "JavaScript"
console.log(box)
```


# Difference between `var` `let` `const`
 #discuss 

`var`
- was used before ES6. 
- var is globally scoped
- We should avoid it may introduce bugs. Generally due to its global scoping.
- can be updated and re-declared
- are initialized with 'undefined'

`let`
- is used to declare Block-scoped variables, i.e. in functions control statements, etc. 
- can be updated but not re-declared as it is in memory already., unless it will throw error
```js
let variable = 40
let variable = "Laugh"
```
```
SyntaxError: Identifier 'variable' has already been declared
```

- not initialized 
```js
let
```
```
ReferenceError: let is not defined
```

`const` 
- used to declare constants. 
- Recommended to use it as much as possible.  Do fact check
- neither updated nor re-declared
- must be initialized at the time of declaration 
```js
const asign = 40
asign = "same"
```
```error
TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
```
**Exception**: 
Alteration in `const` JavaScript Objects.

# Rules for variable names
1. Must begin with `'_'` `'$'` or a letter
2. Names are case sensitive 
3. Reserved keywords not allowed
