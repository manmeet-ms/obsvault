# Asymptotic meaning in DSA
According to context, "asymptotic" typically refers to the behavior of an algorithm as the size of the input approaches infinity. It is used to analyze the efficiency and performance of algorithms by expressing their running time or space complexity in terms of mathematical functions.

Analysis of an algorithm is done based on three cases:
1. Best Case (Omega Notation (Ω))
2. Average Case (Theta Notation (Θ))
3. Worst Case (O Notation(O)) ==➡ Widely Used one==

# Big Oh $(O)$ Notation 
A function $f(n)$ is said to be $O(g_{(n)})$, iff there exist a constant $C$ & constant $n_0$ such that:
#discuss mathematical definition as well.

$$0 \le f(n) \le C  g(n)\ ; \hspace{0.3cm} \forall\hspace{0.3cm} n\ge n_o$$
- This notation represents an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm

> [!Note] 
> - For final answer always report the minimum order
> - $n_0$ is the threshold after which $Cg(n)$ keeps floating above

# Big Omega $(\Omega)$ Notation
A function $f(n)$ is said to be $\Omega(g_{(n)})$, iff there exist a constant $C$ & constant $n_0$ such that:

$$0 \le  C  g(n)\le\ f(n) ; \hspace{0.3cm} \forall\hspace{0.3cm} n\ge n_o$$
Represent lower bound of a function

# Big Theta $(\Theta)$ Notation
Always report $\Theta$ It gives a better picture of analyzing/comparing algorithm.
A function is said to be  $\Theta(g_{(n)})$, if it is Big Oh $O(g(n))$ as well as Big Omega of $\Omega(g(n))$

Q: Prove that $n^2+n+1$ is $O(n^3)$,  $\Omega(n^2)$ and  $\Theta(n^2)$ using respective definition. 
S: as per definition 
$O(n)$ is $0\le f(n)\le C.g(n)$
$\Omega(n)$ is $0\le C.g(n) \le f(n)$
So
$0\le n^2+n+1\le n^3$
will always be true, the condition will also hold truth for $\Omega$ as well in its case

$\therefore$ It will be Big theta of n^2:
1. low order is reported
2. this condition will be true for both big oh ans big omega , then also it will be big theta ☑
