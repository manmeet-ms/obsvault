- **Rug Pulls**: Developers create a new cryptocurrency or project, promote it heavily, and then disappear with investors' funds.
- **Pump and Dump Schemes**: Scammers artificially inflate the price of a cryptocurrency through false or misleading statements, then sell off their holdings at the peak.
- **Fake Exchanges**: Scammers set up fake cryptocurrency exchanges to steal funds from users who believe they are trading on a legitimate platform.

### 3. NFT Forgeries: What steps can you take to verify the authenticity of an NFT?

- **Check Provenance**: Verify the NFT’s history, including its creation, ownership transfers, and previous sales.

- **Verify the Creator**: Research the artist or creator and ensure they are legitimate and recognized in the community.
- **Inspect Metadata**: Examine the metadata associated with the NFT to ensure it matches the description and is unique.

### 4. Social Media Scams: How do scammers use social media platforms to defraud crypto investors?

- **Fake Endorsements**: They fabricate endorsements from celebrities or influencers to lure victims into investing in fake projects.

### 5. Ponzi Schemes: What are the warning signs of a Ponzi scheme in the crypto world?

- **Guaranteed High Returns**: Promises of high returns with little or no risk are a major red flag.
- **Complex and Secretive Strategies**: The investment strategy is often vague or overly complex.
- **Consistent Returns**: The scheme claims to deliver consistent returns regardless of market conditions.
- **Unregistered Investments**: The investment is not registered with financial authorities.
- **Pressure to Reinvest**: There is a strong push to reinvest earnings rather than withdraw them.
- **Difficulty Receiving Payments**: Investors face delays or obstacles when attempting to withdraw their funds.

### 6. Rug Pulls: How can you protect yourself from rug pulls in DeFi and NFT projects?

- **Research the Team**: Investigate the developers and ensure they have a credible background and verifiable identities.
- **Check Liquidity**: Ensure the project has locked liquidity, making it harder for developers to withdraw large amounts suddenly.
- **Review Smart Contracts**: Examine the project’s smart contracts for any potential backdoors or suspicious code.
- **Community Feedback**: Engage with the community and check for any warnings or negative feedback.
- **Avoid Hype**: Be wary of projects that rely heavily on hype and marketing rather than solid fundamentals and development.

# discord's integration with vision (ideas)
## about their company and commnunity they want to build like : 
"ABOUT CREATE A MOMENT THE ABSTRACT PROJECT VISION OUR TEAM WHY GET INVOLVED IN THE MEDIA INTRODUCTION Empowering content creators We are creating an epic community timeline that empowers its creators like no other. A bold statement sure. So how? To be epic, we invite epic creators to continually contribute. First, we onboard the biggest and best creators. We will do something that other social media do not do; hand back data ownership and true control to the users themselves. We believe true ownership can only be built on a decentralized blockchain. Anything else does not guarantee the permanent empowerment of the creator. Data is going to be the currency of the future. It already is, just look at the value of AI and how crazy the world is going for it. Ethical AI requires empowering creators with control of their media. This is what that means to us: I) Keeping your authenticity, all your posts are automatically opted-out of AI training permission. II) Moments (posts) are sent to you for custody immediately after creation. You own your moment! III) You connect to other human beings only instead of to bots impersonating a human. Lets show the world there are things humans will always be better at than the most advanced AI: expressing authentic human-ness! (yes, thats a word) In the age of AI massive value will be harvested from data. Large volumes of ideas, art, science etc all hold value as they drive the underlying statistical models of AI. Most people (aka all of us) give this data away for free on social media platforms. You may not mind giving away pictures of your food, or tweeting “Buy my product!”, but if you are creating something beautiful, inspiring, hilarious, or new that is authentically you, we invite you to own that moment. We need to embrace the fact that giving away data for free, does not work in the best interest of the creator. We believe in your rights. Posting on Ada Moments declares your denial of wanting to be used for AI training. We help keep AI ethical. How will we build in such a way that we protect your data from everyone including ourselves? We put you in undeniable and verifiable control of your data through decentralized blockchain technology. Even we can not delete your creations once they have been made and sent into your custody. That's the beauty of blockchain innit?  The reason is because of the people behind Cardano, their design choices, and first principles approach to systems development. These match our long-term vision. To give permanent and real control to our users. Your account (self custodial “Wallet”) will not just hold crypto coins, it will hold the rights to your data too. Our infrastructure must stay secure and decentralized while scaling with users. We’ve been with Cardano since the beginning (AmsterdamNode.com). In blockchain you hear a lot of promises. We don’t value what blockchain developers say they will do, we value what they actually do. If you follow this logic you understand why we chose Cardano’s infrastructure as starting point. Why We started as AmsterdamNode, built our first project AdaTimeStamp.io - a permanent decentralized museum timeline. A place where creativity, once posted, could never be removed, altered, or deleted from the blockchain’s memory. This original mission still holds but we evolved after community feedback. See our old brochure and technical white paper below. LIGHT-PAPER TECHNICAL WHITEPAPER "I was here" Ada portrait MISSION Our mission is to build an epic timeline where people can express themselves now and for generations to come. TERMS AND CONDITIONS Stories - The Abstract"

## my first suggestions was: 
"> "Adding in custom discord ideas that link to our mission of creating an epic community driven timeline on Cardano's blockchain infrastructure. Moments (posts) = blocks of time"

1. **Proposed Method**: Connect Discord posts to the AdaMoments website, essentially creating a timeline from user posts. Users post in a specific Discord channel.
2. **Data Extraction**: The website uses the Discord API to automatically fetch the post's content (image/text) and timestamp.
3. **Display**: The extracted content is displayed on the AdaMoments website as part of the timeline.

So, the setup could be like this: 
1. The discord community will post their work :arrow_heading_down: 
2. That post will be extracted with timestamp (via discord API) and shown in your website AdaMoments.
